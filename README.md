solitaire_card
==============

Simple card deck class for C++ along with a sample solitaire game.

This is my first "library" as it were to create card games.  It includes various classes to create
one or more decks of cards, shuffle, etc.  If you like it, feel free to use it.  I'm releasing this under
the GNU license.

If you like it and/or want to give feedback, feel free to contact me at jcwiggi@gmail.com
